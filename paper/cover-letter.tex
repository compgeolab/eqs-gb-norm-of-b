Dear Editors,

We are pleased to have the opportunity to submit our original research paper entitled ``\Title{}'' for
consideration by \Journal{}. This paper will be part of my (India Uppalâ€™s) doctoral thesis.

The paper presents a novel adaptation of the equivalent sources technique, dual-layer gradient-boosted equivalent sources, for interpolating magnetic data and predicting the anomalous magnetic field from total-field anomaly data. The method addresses key limitations of existing adaptations by employing a dual-layer approach to improve the fit to both short- and long-wavelengths and mitigate the border effects. To enhance the computational efficiency, the approach incorporates block-averaging and the gradient-boosted equivalent sources method, whilst block K-fold cross-validation is used to assist with optimal parameter selection for the model. The method was tested on synthetic datasets and the ICEGRAV aeromagnetic dataset from the British Antarctic Survey, demonstrating the improved fit to the data and ability to predict the amplitude of the anomalous field from total-field anomaly data.

The manuscript is currently available as a preprint on EarthArXiv at \url{https://doi.org/\PreprintDOI} under the CC-BY license. All the code and data needed to reproduce our results are also provided through \url{https://doi.org/\ArchiveDOI} and GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/\GitHubRepository}, both of which are linked in the paper.

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript. We believe this paper fits very well within the scope of Geophysical Journal International and look forward to your response.
