Potential field data often require interpolation onto a regular grid at constant height before further analysis. A widely used approach for this is the Equivalent Source Technique, which has been adapted over time to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the predictions. However, many of these approaches still face challenges, including border effects in the predictions, reliance on a stabilising parameter, the requirement for regularly gridded data at a constant height. To address these limitations, the Dual-Layer Gradient-Boosted Equivalent Sources aims to: (1) Use the dual layer approach to improve the accuracy of the predictions and reduce the border effect. (2) Use block-averaging and the Gradient-Boosted Equivalent Sources method to reduce the computational load. (3) Apply Block K-Fold Cross Validation to guide optimal parameter selection for the model. The method is tested on both synthetic datasets and the ICEGRAV dataset to evaluate the methods ability to interpolate and upward continue onto a regular grid at constant height.
