- 2.5*grid spacing < (data height - source height) < 6*grid spacing
    - this is for gravity data, would the limits be different for magnetics?
    - Used this for deep sources
    - Not used this for shallow sources - need to justify why?

\section{Introduction}

Here's a text citation of \citet{OliveiraJr2015}
and a another version that is sometimes used \citep{OliveiraJr2015}.

The different gridding methods, such as inverse-distance weights, polynomical fitting, spline functions (Briggs, 1974), often assume potential data are not harmonic functions. However, the total field anomaly is harmonic when the magnitude is much smaller than the magnitude of the geomagnetic field; this is true for most instances in which the total field anomaly is observed. 

Airborne data often have more data points along flight lines and much larger gaps between flight lines. The equivalent source (EQS) technique takes into account the irregularly spaced grids and the variable heights of the observed data. The EQS technique can be used for reduction to the pole, upwards continuation, modelling the lithospheric magnetic field, etc.

The norm of the magnetic field is less dependent on the direction of magnetisation. This is particularly useful for areas with remanent magnetisation, low magnetic latitudes, sources with shallow inclination directions and sources with an unknown magnetised directions (Hidalgo-Gato, et al., 2021; Melo, et al., 2021).

\section{Methodology}
The observed total field anomaly, \textcolor{orange}{$\Delta T$}, has N numbrt of data points with positions $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$, where $x_i$ points in the geographic north direction, $y_i$ points in the east direction and $z_i$ points upwards (see orange diamonds in figure XX).


is the difference between the observed magnetic total field intensity vector, $\vec{T}$, and the regional reference field vector, $\vec{F}$:
\begin{equation}
    \textcolor{orange}{\Delta T} = \left\lVert \vec{T} \right\rVert - \left\lVert \vec{F} \right\rVert,
\end{equation}
where the observed $\vec{T}$, is the sum of the anomalous magnetic field vector, $\vec{B}$, and $\vec{F}$:
\begin{equation}
    \textcolor{orange}{\Delta T} = \left\lVert \vec{F} + \vec{B} \right\rVert - \left\lVert \vec{F} \right\rVert.
\end{equation}
Since the $\vec{B}$ is much smaller in comparison to the $\vec{F}$, \deltaT can be approximated as the dot product of the \vec{B} and the regional field direction, \hat{F}:
\begin{equation}
    \textcolor{orange}{\Delta T} \approx  \vec{B} \cdot \hat{F}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Equivalent Source Technique}
\cite{Cordell1992}'s ‘generalized equivalent sources’ assumes any harmonic function $d_i$ can be approximated by the sum of $m$ discrete point source effects:
\begin{equation}
d_i = \sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j f_{ij}(x,y,z)
\end{equation}

These equations can also be expressed in matrix form as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{Ac}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{d}$ is the column vector of $n$ predicted values at the observation points, $\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector of $m$ coefficients (moment magnitude) and $\mathbf{A}$ is the $n \times m$ sensitivity (Jacobian) matrix. By minimising the goal function,
\begin{equation}
    \phi(c) = [\mathbf{d}^0 - \mathbf{Ac}]^T W[\mathbf{d}^0 - \mathbf{Ac}] + \lambda_d \mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{c}
\end{equation}
the values of the source coefficients, $c$, that best fit the observed field values can be obtained using the difference between the observed and the predicted data. If the difference is as close as possible to zero, the observed and predicted data are very similar. Therefore, the smallest,
\begin{equation}
    \phi(c) = min
\end{equation}
gives the best fit. Therefore, the derivetive of $\phi$ is equal to zero.

\subsection{Gradient Boosting}
Estimating the source coefficients that best fit the observed data is computationally demanding. To overcome this problem, \cite{SolerUieda2021} used the gradient boosted method in which the source coefficients are estimated in overlapping windows and carried out iteratively. This gradient boosted method was applied to the shallow layer of equivalent sources.

\subsection{Norm of B Predictions}
The amplitude of the magnetic anomaly $B$ is weakly dependent on the direction of magnetisation compared the total field anomaly $F$ \cite{HidalgoGato2021}. By calculating the norm of the magnetic anomalous field, the data is less dependent on the direction of Earth’s main field and crustal magnetisation.

\subsection{Dual Layer Concept}
Two layers of equivalent sources was used to fit both, the regional magnetic field and the shallow magnetic anomalies. \cite{Li2019} found having an additional deeper layer of equivalent sources reduced the misfit, especially for the long‐wavelength fields. By using two layers, the deeper equivalent source layer can capture the regional, long-wavelength signals, whilst the shallower layer can capture the short-wavelength signals. For this dual layer process, firstly the deeper layer of equivalent sources is calculated to determine the regional field. To determine the depth of this layer, a lower and upper bound of 2.5 and 6 times the distance of the nearest neighbouring data point respectively was used \cite{Dampney1969}. The residual field between the deep equivalent source layer prediction and the data is then used to calculate the shallow equivalent source layer. Adding both the deep and shallow equivalent source layer predictions together creates the final prediction for the data.

\subsection{Block Averaging}
Block averaging the data reduces the computational load and the likelihood of overfitting the data. Due to the nature of aliasing flight line data, block averaging can balance the equivalent sources along and adjacent flight lines to reduce this effect \cite{SolerUieda2021}. Furthermore, by block averaging the data when calculating the deep equivalent sources, only the long-wavelength signals are captured, rather than both short and long wavelength signals. When the block average is too small, more short wavelength signals are captured and not all of the long wavelength signals from the regional field are captured. Too large block averaging, not all the regional signals are captured either. Therefore, different block averaging sizes were calculated to determine the optimum size for capturing only the long wavelength signals. To reduce the computational load when calculating the shallow equivalent sources, block averaging the same size as the grid spacing of the predicted data was applied.

\subsection{K-Fold Cross-Validation}
The model requires manual parameter selection for the damping, depth of equivalent sources and window size for the gradient boosting. In order to select the optimal parameter combination, K-Fold Crosss Validation (K-CV) was used. K-CV is a popular machine learning method often used for model selection. Data is divided into k number of folds, that are as equal as possible in size. One of the k folds is used as testing set and the remaining (k-1) folds are used as training sets. This is repeated iteratively until all k folds have been used as both testing and training sets. The K-CV error estimation is the root mean square error (RMSE) of all the errors from each fold calculation. The parameter combination with the smallest RMSE is selected for the model.
